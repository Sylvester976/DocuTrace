# DocuTrace

DocuTrace is a free and open-source document tracking system designed to enhance the security, efficiency, and transparency of document routing within organizations. It aims to improve interdepartmental coordination by providing real-time updates and tracking of documents through the approval, review, and sign-off processes.

## Problem Statement

In many government and organizational workflows, documents go through several departments, with multiple people reviewing and approving them. Tracking these documents manually can be time-consuming, prone to errors, and inefficient. There is often no visibility into the status of a document or who has it at any given time. DocuTrace seeks to solve these issues by providing a centralized, secure system for tracking documents, ensuring they move smoothly through the approval process.

## Users

DocuTrace is designed to serve multiple user roles, each with distinct needs and responsibilities:

- **Admins:** Oversee system configuration, user management, and document tracking. They ensure smooth operation and monitor progress across departments.
- **Department Heads:** Track the progress of documents within their departments and ensure that documents are reviewed and approved on time.
- **Staff/Users:** Initiate, review, and approve documents as part of their workflow. They receive notifications about document statuses and updates.
- **External Users:** If applicable, these users may be able to track public documents or provide approval through a secure interface.

## Core Features

- **Document Routing:** Documents can be routed across departments and users in a predefined sequence, ensuring that the right people review and approve the document at each step.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Users will be notified in real time when a document moves through the system, ensuring that they’re always aware of the document’s status.
- **Secure Tracking:** The system ensures that documents are routed securely with a full audit trail, tracking who accessed and modified the document at each stage.
- **Notifications:** Users will receive updates on the status of documents they are responsible for, with the ability to view pending or completed actions.
- **Interdepartmental Coordination:** The system facilitates smooth communication between departments by tracking documents as they move through different stages of review and approval.

## Value Proposition

- **Efficiency:** By automating the routing of documents, DocuTrace reduces the time spent manually tracking documents, increasing productivity across the organization.
- **Transparency:** Users can always see the current status of a document, enhancing accountability and reducing delays caused by unclear responsibilities.
- **Security:** The system ensures that only authorized users can access or modify documents, maintaining confidentiality and integrity throughout the process.
- **Real-time Updates:** With notifications and real-time tracking, users are always in the loop, leading to quicker decision-making.
